  <h5> women’s rights</h5>
        <p>The first achievement was Wu’s support of women’s rights. 
            She advised women to write and edit biographies of exemplary women to assist in the attainment of her political objectives. Wu asserted that the 
            ideal ruler was one who ruled as a mother does over her children. Wu also extended the mourning period for a 
            deceased mother to equal that of a deceased father and raised the position of her mother’s clan by offering 
            her relatives high official posts. She may have thought that princesses were conducive to reconciling 
            diplomatic conflicts, since she formed marriage alliances to aid her expansionist foreign policy. </p>
      
      <h5>economic development</h5>
      <p>
        The second achievement was Wu’s policy of economic development. Wu became interested with agriculture, and ordered
        the compilation of farming textbooks, construction of irrigation systems, reduction of taxes etc.
         In 695, she offered the entire empire a tax-free year. Despite this, her tax office 
         still benefited from trade opportunities through the Silk Roads between China, Central Asia, and the West.
          Her economic policies apparently improved the lives of the poor, giving them hope of bright future. 
          although some historians say that Wu lived lavishly afterwards because Buddhist monasteries  were built to 
          satisfy her private needs. In the eyes of the common people, she was most likely popular ruler.
          
      </p>  
<h5>buddhism</h5>
      <p>
        The third achievement was Wu’s patronage of Buddhism. After she gained power, Wu helped spread and helped 
        and supported Buddhism by building temples so that priests could explain Buddhist texts. 
        Wu’s Buddhist sect also encouraged its followers to regard their earthly ruler as the representative
         of Vairocana Buddha, a belief that Wu probably regarded quite favorably as Empress.
            In 692, she issued an edict forbidding the butchery of pigs. In the eyes of Chinese Buddhists,
            Due to this Wu might have been a popular ruler.
      </p>
          <p>These achievements are only to name a few. over the many years during her ruling, she accomplished much more</p>
