        <div class="achievements-content">
            <h5>recruiting officials</h5>
        <p >The first achievement was Wu Zhao’s policy of recruiting officials. The basic criteria of selection of 
            officialdom shifted from personal integrity or conduct to a greater emphasis on candidates’ education levels 
            and intellectual capabilities. By implementing this change, Wu broadened eligibility for the bureaucracy by 
            placing more emphasis on recruiting talented and educated aristocrats, scholars, and military leaders than 
            limiting high officials to a few powerful aristocratic clans. This may have been the reason she avoided any 
            mutiny that threatened her regime. In 693, Wu wrote the two-volume Rules for Officials and made it part of
             the examination curriculum, replacing the old Daoist classic, Daode Jing. She even initiated the personal 
             examination of candidates by the ruler because she believed this system could best serve her objective of 
             effective Imperial management. The civil service examination was not new in Tang China,
             but Wu’s reforms would serve as a foundation for later dynasties developing an even stronger examination 
             system.</p>
  
  <h5> women’s rights</h5>
        <p>The second achievement was Wu’s support of women’s rights. 
            She began a series of campaigns to uplift the position of women. She advised scholars to write and edit 
            biographies of exemplary women to assist in the attainment of her political objectives. Wu asserted that the 
            ideal ruler was one who ruled as a mother does over her children. Wu also extended the mourning period for a 
            deceased mother to equal that of a deceased father and raised the position of her mother’s clan by offering 
            her relatives high official posts. She may have thought that princesses were conducive to reconciling 
            diplomatic conflicts, since she formed marriage alliances to aid her expansionist foreign policy. </p>
      
      <h5>economic development</h5>
      <p>
        The third achievement was Wu’s policy of economic development. Agriculture caught the attention of Wu, who ordered
        the compilation of farming textbooks, construction of irrigation systems, reduction of taxes, and other agrarian
         reform measures. In 695, for example, Wu offered the entire empire a tax-free year. Despite this, her tax office 
         still benefited from trade opportunities through the Silk Roads between China, Central Asia, and the West.
          Her economic policies apparently improved the life of peasants, moving them toward prosperity and peace. 
          Some historians argue that Wu lived in extravagance in later years because of showy Buddhist monasteries built to 
          satisfy her private needs. However, in the eyes of the common people, she may have been an incredibly popular ruler.
           Evidence from a stele in Sichuan Province shows that, in time of flood or drought, people pray at a temple in the
            name of “Celestial Empress.” She is still honored today by an annual agricultural festival there, especially on her
            birthday.
      </p>  
<h5>buddhism</h5>
      <p>
        The fourth achievement was Wu’s patronage of Buddhism. As a child, Wu was introduced to Buddhism by her parents,
         and, as noted earlier, she was briefly a Buddhist nun. After she gained power, Wu helped spread and consolidate
          Buddhism and supported the religion by erecting temples so priests could explain Buddhist texts. She thought 
          highly of Huayan Buddhism, which regarded Vairocana Buddha as the center of the world, very similar to Wu’s 
          desire to become the holy emperor. Wu’s Buddhist sect also encouraged its followers to regard their earthly 
          ruler as the representative of Vairocana Buddha, a belief that Wu probably regarded quite favorably as Empress.
           Wu assumed herself a reborn Buddha and a descendent of the ancient Zhou kings. In 692, she issued an edict 
           forbidding the butchery of pigs. In the eyes of Chinese Buddhists, Wu may have been a popular ruler.
            Her patronage of Buddhism paved the way for its spread during the reign of Emperor Ruizong, when voluminous 
            Buddhist texts were translated, edited, and published.
