        <p >Wu Zetian was born on February 17, 624 in Lizhou and died in December 16, 705 in Luoyang, China at the age 
            of 81. She grew up in a wealthy aristocratic family and her father was a high 
            ranking minister in the government. Unlike many girls of her time, Wu was given a good education. She was taught to read, write,
            and to play music.</p><br>
            <p>Wu Zhao entered the palace of the Tang emperor Taizong (ruled 626–649) in 638, at the age of 14, as a junior concubine. 
                By that time, the Tang dynasty had recently reunited China, largely through the efforts of Taizong. Little is known of Wu’s life as a concubine of Taizong, but, on his death in 649, 
                she is traditionally said to have already entered into intimate relations with his heir, the Gaozong emperor. </p>
