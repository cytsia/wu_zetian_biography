        <p>Wu has a reputation of being one of the most cruel rulers in China’s history. She remains a controversial figure
             primarily because of stories about her personal actions against rivals. Male Confucian officials who were deeply
              prejudiced against strong and ambitious women undoubtedly exaggerated this aspect of Wu’s life in later accounts of 
              her reign. Still, there is also substantial verifiable evidence of her ruthlessness toward powerful real or imagined opponents.</p>
        <br>
              <p >When Taizong died, she became first concubine to Emperor Gaozong and had two sons and two daughters with him. 
            She killed her first-born daughter and blamed the death on Emperor Gaozong’s wife, Lady Wang. Emperor Gaozong, then,
             exiled his wife and made Wu Zetian his new wife. While being the emperor’s wife, Wu Zetian ruled from behind the scenes because Gaozong suffered a stroke and was often too sick to rule.
             As de-facto ruler, she organized a successful military campaign against Korea.</p><br>
            <p>Even though Wu died over 1,300 years ago, she remains a well-known figure in China’s past and controversy still surrounds her.</p>
